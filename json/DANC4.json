by Richard Sabey <cryptic_fan@hotmail.com> 9.2003\n    This font is based on the \"dancing men\" cipher used in Sir Arthur Conan\nDoyle's Sherlock Holmes story \"The Adventure of the Dancing Men\" (DANC),\nwhich was later published in the collection \"The Return of Sherlock Holmes\".\n    The cipher ignores punctuation, and marks a space by a flag held by the\ndancing man for the last letter before the space. The last figure of\nan entire message carries no flag, as there is no need for one. In this\nimplementation of the cipher, figures with no flags represent lowercase\nletters; those with flags, uppercase letters. Thus, when FIGletising, you\nshould type only the letters, and uppercase the *last* letter of every word\nexcept the last. For example \"Come, Elsie!\" becomes comEelsie.\n    The messages in dancing-men cipher in DANC didn't use the letters\nFJKQUWXZ. What's more, editions of DANC vary in what mistakes they make in\nthe cipher, though they are consistent in using the same figure for P & V.\nTo resolve this problem and supply the missing figures, I follow the TrueType\nfont designed in 1994 by Martin Bergman of Sweden.\n    The positions of the flags have been altered to keep this a 4-line FIGfont.\n\n\n","numChars":102}
